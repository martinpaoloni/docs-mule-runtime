=== Input Sources

The Azure Service Bus connector has two input sources:

* <<queuelistener, Queue listener>>
* <<subscriptionlistener, Subscription listener>>

[[queuelistener]]
==== Queue Listener Configuration

Configure the *Queue listener* source as follows:

image::microsoft-azure-sb-queuereceiver.png[Queue Source]

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|*Queue name* | Queue to receive events. To receive events from the dead letter queue, specify `QueueName/$deadletterqueue`.
|*Receive mode*
a|
* `MANUAL`: User must manually acknowledge messages.
* `AUTOMATIC`: Message is acknowledged from the queue and then deleted from the queue after it is received.
If a message is not acknowledged, it times out and goes to the end of the queue.
|*Server timeout (ms)*| Maximum duration, in milliseconds, within which the client keeps renewing the message lock if the processing of the message is not completed by the handler.
|*Prefetch count*| When `Prefetch` is enabled in any of the official Service Bus clients, the receiver acquires additional messages, up to the `PrefetchCount` limit. This can be more messages than what the application initially requested. Set this field to 0 to disable prefetching.
|*Cron Expression*| (Optional) UNIX CRON expression that specifies when to trigger the receiver action. For example, setting this field to `0 0 * * *`  triggers the receiver action at midnight (00:00) every day.
|*Max. messages to receive*| Maximum number of messages to receive during the scheduled operation.
|===

[[subscriptionlistener]]
==== Subscription Listener Configuration

Configure the *Subscription listener* source as follows:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|*Topic* | Name of the topic to connect to.
|*Subscription*| Subscription to receive events. To receive events from the dead letter queue, specify `QueueName/$deadletterqueue`.
|*Receive Mode*
a|
* MANUAL: Specifies that the user must manually acknowledge messages.
* AUTOMATIC: Message is acknowledged from the queue and then deleted from the queue after it is received.
If a message is not acknowledged, it times out and goes to the end of the queue.
|*Server timeout (ms)*| Maximum duration within which the client keeps renewing the message lock if message processing is not completed by the handler.
|*Prefetch Count*| When `Prefetch` is enabled in any of the official Service Bus clients, the receiver acquires additional messages, up to the `PrefetchCount` limit. This can be more messages than what the application initially requested. Set this field to 0 to disable prefetching.
|*Cron Expression*| (Optional) UNIX CRON expression that specifies when to trigger the receiver action. For example, setting this field to `0 0 * * *`  triggers the receiver action at midnight (00:00) every day.
|*Max. Messages to Receive*| Maximum number of messages to receive during the scheduled operation.

== Use Cases

This topic contains the following use cases:

* <<basic>>
* <<manualack>>
* <<scheduled>>
* <<batch>>
* <<enqueuing>>

[[basic]]
=== Send a Message to a Queue or Topic

This example configures a Mule app to send a message to an Azure Service Bus queue or topic. The following diagram shows the flow for this example:

image::microsoft-azure-sb-example-send-flow.png[Sending a message to a queue or topic]

. Create a new Mule app in Studio.
. Add an *HTTP* connector as the flow source.
. In the HTTP connector configuration *General* tab, set the *Path* field to`/''.
. Click *+* next to the *Connector Configuration* field, and then set the *Port* field to `8081`.
. Add a *Set Payload* or *Transform Message* transformer, and enter a message value for the queue.
. Drag the *Microsoft Azure Service Bus* connector next to the *Set Payload* or *Transform Message* transformer on the canvas.
. Configure the connector as follows:
** Select the *Publish message* operation and *Destination type* (`QUEUE` or `TOPIC`).
** Enter the value for *Destination name*.
. Because the *Publish message* operation has no return value, use another *Set Payload* transformer to return a message: `#["message sent"]`.

When you call `http://localhost:8081/send`, the connector uploads the message to the queue.

[[manualack]]
=== Receive Messages from a Queue or Topic with a Manual Acknowledge Message

This example configures a Mule app to send an acknowledgement after receiving a message from a queue or topic. The following diagram shows the flow for this example:

image::microsoft-azure-sb-example-ack-flow.png[Sending a message to a queue or topic]

. Create a new Mule app in Studio.
. Add a *Microsoft Azure Service Bus* connector as the flow source, and configure the connector:
** In the *Operation field*, select *Queue listener* or *Subscription listener*.
** To send messages to a queue, enter the name of the queue in the *Queue name* field.
** To send messages to a topic, enter the name of the topic in the *Topic* field and the name of the subscription in the *Subscription* field.
. Set the *Receive mode* field to `MANUAL`.
. Drag a *Record Variable*, *Session Variable*, or *Variable* transformer next to the *Microsoft Azure Service Bus* on the canvas.
. Store the lock token value from the received message using this expression: `#[message.inboundProperties.get('lockToken')]`
. For testing purposes, perform an action with the message, such as logging it by using a *Logger* component.
. Add another *Microsoft Azure Service Bus* connector next to the variable component on the canvas, and select the *Acknowledge message* operation.
. For the *Lock* field value, retrieve the stored `lockToken` value.

The connector processes every message received and acknowledges each message that is processed successfully.

To have the connector automatically acknowledge messages, set the *Receive mode* field to `AUTOMATIC`.

[[scheduled]]
=== Schedule the Reception of Messages

The following example configures a Mule app that receives messages from a queue or topic on a specified schedule:

Create a Mule app to receive messages from a queue or topic, as described in <<basic>>.

When you create the app:

* Set the *CRON Expression* field to a CRON expression that follows the UNIX standard. For example, to connect and receive messages every day at 8 AM, use `0 8 * * *`.
* Set the *Max. Messages to receive* field to the maximum number of messages for the connector to receive every time the CRON expression triggers a receive.

The connector executes a batch receive every time the CRON expression commands it. Any number of available messages up to the maximum set are retrieved and processed by the flow.

[[batch]]
=== Send Multiple Messages to a Queue

The following example configures a Mule app to send multiple messages to a queue:

. Create a Mule app to receive messages from a queue or topic, as described in <<basic>>.
. Replace the *Publish message* operation with the *Publish batch of messages* operation. Make sure the *Destination type* and *Destination name* are properly set.
. When crafting the message, be sure to create a comma-separated list of strings, because the app will send many messages simultaneously.
+
To split a comma-separated string of messages separated into separate messages, drag a *Transform message* transformer to the canvas and use the following script:
```
%dw 1.0
%output application/java
---
payload splitBy ','
```

[[enqueuing]]
=== Schedule the Logical Enqueuing of a Message

The following example configures a Mule app to send a message to all listeners at a specified time:

. Create a Mule app to receive messages from a queue or topic, as described in <<basic>>.
. In the properties window for the Azure Service Bus connector, enter a value for the *Scheduled enqueue time UTC"* field with the date or time when you want the message to be dispatched. For example: `2019-06-27T21:16:46.866Z`.
+
The message is sent to the destination, which will dispatch the message at the specified time.

== Supported REST Operations

The Azure Service Bus connector supports the following Azure Service Bus REST API operations:

* Queue
** Create
** Get
** Get Size
** List
** Update
** Delete
* Topic
** Create
** Get
** List
** Update
** Delete
* Subscription
** Create
** Get
** Get Size
** List

* Rule
** Create
** Get
** List
** Update
** Delete

== Additional Configuration Information

=== Queue and Subscription Listener Operations

For the *Queue listener* and *Subscription* listener operations, the output payload is a string with the message. The connector returns additional attributes in the outbound properties.

=== Restricted Access Policies

In situations where your resources can only send and receive amqp messages, enable the option *AMQP-only credentials* inside the *Advanced* tab.

=== Handling a Very High Number of Messages

If Mule processes a very high number of messages (such as thousands per second), especially if it publishes to and reads from the same destination in one Mule app, you might see messages like the following in the log:

```
[ERROR 2019-05-22 00:15:26,362 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3] com.microsoft.azure.servicebus.MessageAndSessionPump: onMessage with message containing sequence number '95' threw exception com.mulesoft.connectors.microsoft.azure.servicebus.internal.error.exception.ConsumerException: Failed setting attributes from original API message.]
```
The error can occur because Mule processes errors asynchronously by default. To fix this error, select  `queue-asynchronous` when you configure the message listener in a flow.
If a message waits for more than 30,000 ms to be processed by the flow, Mule throws an exception that causes an error (timeout in the Mule SEDA queue).

To avoid this error, create a custom queue-asynchronic configuration and do either or both of the following:

* Increase the number of threads in the `maxThreads` property (default 16).
* Increase the waiting time in the `threadWaitTimeout`property` (default 30,000 ms).

To modify the configuration:

. Select the flow.
. Select *General* -> *Optional Processing Strategy* -> *Processing Strategy Ref*.
. Click *+*.
. Add a new *Queued Asynchronous Processing Strategy*.

For more information, see xref:flow-processing-strategies.adoc[Flow Processing Strategies].

=== Random Errors When Using a Manual ACK

You might receive errors like this one when working with a high number of messages while a using manual ACK:

```
[com.mulesoft.connectors.microsoft.azure.servicebus.internal.error.exception.ConsumerException: Message with lockToken 2dc1312f-b263-4282-bbb0-566998eff6e6 could not be ACK at com.mulesoft.connectors.microsoft.azure.servicebus.internal.connection.Connection.ack(Connection.java:192)][ERROR 2019-05-22 00:17:30,822 [ReactorThread6f355ff5-5a36-487b-bb70-1a995a6ddf74] com.microsoft.azure.servicebus.primitives.CoreMessageReceiver: Completing pending updateState operation for delivery '?     ? &??I??=????' with exception com.microsoft.azure.servicebus.primitives.MessageLockLostException: The lock supplied is invalid. Either the lock expired, or the message has already been removed from the queue.]
```
When the connector performs a prefetch, the lockToken's validity time is fixed in relation to that moment. The problem arises when the lockToken's validity time is not long enough to process the entire batch of records. In these cases, Mule might throw an error because the lockToken expired before you do an ACK.

To prevent this issue, reduce the size of the prefetch (default 100), and increase the validity time of the lock token, or both. You can do this in the *lock duration* property when creating the queue or subscription from the connector or from the Azure portal (for existing queues). The maximum duration value for the lock token in Azure is 5 minutes (300 seconds).

=== Reduce Noise in Mule Apps Logs

In some circumstances, the underlying library used by the connector might regularly log complete stack traces with level WARN. These messages do not represent an issue, but they can clutter the logs. To reduce the noise in the logs, make either of the following changes to the `src/main/resources/log4j2.xml` file:

* Specify an *AsyncLogger* for the library's package, raising the level of the log:

```
<!-- Recommended for packages not belonging to Mule -->
<AsyncLogger name="com.microsoft.azure.servicebus" level="ERROR"/>
```

* Add a *RegexFilter* to the existing appender (that is, RollingFile):

```
<!-- Avoids the log of messages that contain the specified regexp -->
<RegexFilter regex = ".message to filter.*" onMatch="DENY" onMismatch="ACCEPT"/>
```
IMPORTANT: If the message is multiline, *RegexFilter* might not work correctly.

=== Listeners (Sources) in Network Disconnection and Reconnection Scenarios

When there are network connection problems, you can direct the source components for the  Azure Service Bus connector to automatically execute reconnection attempts by specifying a reconnection strategy. You can specify a reconnection strategy when you create or edit the connector configuration:

. In the *General* tab of the connector configuration, select *+* next to the *Connector Configuration* field.
. Select one of the *Connector Configuration* options.
. In the *Reconnection* tab, select *Standard Reconnection*.
. Optionally, specify a nondefault value for the *Frequency (ms)* and *Reconnection Attempts* fields.

=== Eventual Send Operation Timed Out

When there are micro-cuts in the network connection, asynchronous message-sending flows might experience exceptions and message losses.

This happens because Azure TimeoutException exceptions (`com.microsoft.azure.servicebus.primitives.TimeoutException`) are not affected by connector reconnection strategies. Therefore, if an exception is generated within a thread pool that executes calls asynchronously, the exception does not use a catch exception strategy. To implement this strategy, you must use XML to program a solution in the Mule app flow.
